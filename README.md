# .files

This is a configuration repository to get a new development environment up and running with familiar settings.

# installation
Clone this repo into your home directory
```
$ git clone git@github.com:rolme/.files.git
```

This will create a ~/.files directory. Then you can run the installer.
```
$ ~/.files/install.sh
```

This will:
* install Oh-My-Zsh! if it is not installed.
* Add custom plugins and themes.
* Create the code and projects directory.

Eventually, this will check the repo for any updates and ask me if I want the latest and greatest.
