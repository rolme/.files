# .files

This is a configuration repository to get a new development environment up and running with familiar settings.

# installation
Clone this repo into your home directory
sh```
$ git clone git@github.com:rolme/.files.git
```

This will create a ~/.files directory. Then you can run the installer.
sh```
$ cd ~/.files/install.sh
```

This will install Oh-My-Zsh! if it is not installed. Then configure it to use custom plugins and themes. Eventually, this will check the repo for any updates and ask me if I want the latest and greatest.

## thanks
